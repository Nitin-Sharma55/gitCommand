First make a new repository, then copy the url of your repository

git push origin master => this is the command to add or commmit your folder/project on the github 
   push => push the changes
   origin => name of the url to which you want to push the changes
   master => branch which you want to push

   why we create branch ?
   we create branch so that we don't commit directly on our main branch, So the question arises why we cannot commit directly to the main branch ? Let's understand this so if our code have some error and we directly commit it to our main branch then there will be lots of problem to the user or to the project we are working on, to avoid that complications arised due to our commit on the main branch we create a new branch and commit to that so if their are any error in our commit it won't effect the whole system/project.
